This project uses the Tkinter library from Python.  
How it works:

-when you start it, it shows one 1 in french and after 3 seconds, it shows the word in english  
-after the english word shows up, you have to check the right or wrong button depending if you knew the meaning of the french word   
-after you finish the word list, a csv with the words you did not know will be created  
-you can modify the list of words by changing the csv files from the project
